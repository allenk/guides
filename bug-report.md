Writing a Bug/Issue Report
==========================

A bug report should have the following sections:
- [Title](#title)
- [What I Did](#what-i-did)
- [What I Expected to Happen](#what-i-expected-to-happen)
- [What Actually Happened](#what-actually-happened)
- [Environment Details](#environment-details)

#### Title

A short (< 100 characters) overview of the issue to distinguish it from others. This should not include specifics.

#### What I Did

If necessary, describe the actions you took to get to this point. Do not talk about the actual bug here. For most web projects, this will just be the url of where you went, and if a login is involved.

#### What I Expected to Happen

Describe what it is that you think should have happened.

This is important, as it helps sort out actual bugs from peoples' own personal expectations.

#### What Actually Happened

Finally! The actual bug! Describe what happened. Add screenshots.

The temptation is to only write this section, but it's often useless, or at the least not very useful without the others.

#### Environment Details

The details of the computer, browser, etc. that the person is experiencing this in, or any other details about their setup.

For websites, this should be a pdf report from [Support Details](http://supportdetails.com/). Not someone saying 'IE'. We need *details* - versions, OS details, etc.
