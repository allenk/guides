Handling Issues
===============

You can close Issues in Bitbucket using a commit message. This helps tie up Issues and relates them to a commit that can be cross-checked.

You can use any of these words:

- close
- closes
- closed
- closing
- fix
- fixed
- fixes
- fixing
- resolve
- resolves
- resolved
- resolving

For example:

~~~
close #845

fix bug #89

fixes issue 746

resolving #3117
~~~
